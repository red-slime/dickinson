				Better spaces mean better lives: that’s one of the many lessons I was
				fortunate enough to have learned from my mentor, father, and namesake.
				The training I received from my Dad, along with my degrees from Georgia
				Tech and 23 years of experience since, have shaped me into an architect
				well versed in a variety of design styles that I can apply to projects
				from renovations to new construction. I know that no single design
				approach is the right one for every client. That is why I allow the
				building program and context direct design decisions.

				Like good art, good architecture should make us think. I believe that
				buildings will tell you what they want to be if you listen hard enough,
				and I believe the built environment has the potential to engage us and
				make us appreciate where we are. These are the principles I have used to
				guide my career, much of which has been spent at Dickinson Architects. I
				interned at this firm between earning my Bachelor of Science at Georgia
				Tech and returned after I received my Master of Architecture, also from
				Tech, because I loved the idea of shaping my hometown’s sense of place.

				I am a LEED Accredited Professional and an Augustan since the age of 2.
				My husband and I went to the same high school and college, but did not

				always listen to your mother, she knows what’s good for you… now if only
				I can convince my children of that fact!

				I have always been fascinated by stories and have used my passion for
				creativity to take the narratives I see all around me to the next level.
				Since buildings tell the story of our culture and act as a stage for our
				lives, pursuing a career in architecture was the perfect fit for me. My
				time at Savannah College of Art and Design, where I received a Bachelor
				of Fine Arts and a Master of Architecture, sharpened my ability to bring
				all my ideas together and provided me with the tools to make my designs
				a reality.

				graphic design and disc golf.

				I had always been interested in a career in Interior Design and, in high
				school in Dublin, Georgia, I was able to take classes that only
				furthered that interest. Once I received my bachelor’s degree in
				interior design from Georgia Southern University, I began my career at
				Dickinson Architects. I have been here 5 years, during which time I
				earned my Interior Designer registration and worked on projects of all
				shapes and sizes, from schools and offices to hotels and restaurants.
				Clients know they can trust me to bring their ideas to life, although
				I’ll always push the envelope and see how many colors I can incorporate
				into my designs. For me, design not only allows you to influence how a
				space will be enjoyed, but how it will be experienced.

				I have had a passion and desire to create since I was a child. Much of
				my young life was spent in artistic pursuits and, during a high school
				drafting class, I became interested in a career in architecture. I
				graduated from the Boston Architectural College with a Bachelor of
				Architecture. Boston is overflowing with examples of great architecture
				and was an incredible place to earn a degree in the field. Once I
				graduated, my family and I decided to move to the south, and I began
				working for Dickinson Architects.

				I graduated from Augusta Technical College in 2014 with a degree in
				Architecture & Engineering Technology and was hired by Dickinson
				Architects shortly afterwards. I feel really fortunate to have been here
				for the past 8 years because I have learned so much that has allowed me
				to further my career and given me a deeper understanding of architecture
				and the building process. Working on a project and seeing it come to
				life brings a deep since of pride to what I do, and I especially love
				sharing our work with others. The drone footage you see on our website
				is my creation (I’m an FAA certified drone operator) and gives me and
				others a real sense of the great designs our firm produces.

The exterior design was crafted to act as a beacon attracting patrons to the facility, and a contemporary blend of brick, cast stone, and metal wall paneling helps distinguish the clinic from its surroundings. Each subsequent facility followed the original’s design with subtle variations based on size and location. Completed MedNows include ones in South Augusta, Grovetown, and Thomson. Facilities in Elberton and Washington are currently in production.",
